We've been working on Copperhead for a few months now and with the launch
of our website we decided to make it official. Below we've provided some
information about what we've been working on and our next plans.

### Background

The three of us come from varied backgrounds including software
development, systems, and forensics. We all shared a common interest in
security research and hardening systems.

We noticed that most small infosec companies tend to either focus solely
on red-teaming and penetration testing, or are corporate forensics
firms. While appreciating the value of both, we saw a gap in the market
for our firm to specialize in defensive security, by understanding
offensive methods, and being capable of detecting and mitigating attacks.

The infosec world is largely attacker-driven and quality defensive
software/tactics are severely lacking. This is something we hope to help
change. As a result we have two complementary objectives: provide
consulting services to organizations, and building a secure Android OS
to protect sensitive mobile communications.

### Consulting Services

We plan to work with organizations such as law firms, tech companies, and other
businesses who need to protect sensitive information. Offering services such as:

- Hardening devices, networks, and systems against attacks
- Secure smartphone deployments
- Source-code security audits
- Certified forensics services, including expert witness testimony
- Incident response
- Malware forensics and mitigation
- Training in security practices such as encryption toolsets, operations
  security, and counter-intelligence

consulting](https://copperhead.co).

### Secure Phones

In addition to consulting we are building a secure version of Android
called Copperhead OS.

Our team members have made an art out of hardening their own desktop
machines from attacks. But smartphones have always presented a hurdle.
Even among experienced programmers and security researchers we spoke to,
few had experience securing their mobile devices.

Seeing a need for a secure-by-default version of Android, we decided to
fork Cyanogenmod, harden the underlying system in every way possible,
and release our own ROM entirely open-source. Similar to how there are
different distros of Linux, we see the need for more open-source options
in Android.

We also plan to sell smartphones that are pre-installed with
Copperhead OS and provide support services for organizations looking to
deploy secure phones within their company.

We launched a landing page for our [secure android OS](/android)
and will release a blog post with more information soon.
